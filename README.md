# Skin Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the early detection of skin cancer using image analysis techniques. Leveraging deep learning algorithms and computer vision, this project focuses on analyzing images of skin lesions to classify them into benign or malignant categories. By training on a dataset of labeled skin images, the model learns to identify patterns and features indicative of various types of skin cancer.

## INTRODUCTION

Skin cancer is one of the most active types of cancer in the present decade. As the skin is the body’s largest organ, the point of considering skin cancer as the most common type of cancer among humans is understandable. It is generally classified into two major categories: melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. Melanoma is a hazardous, rare, and deadly type of skin cancer. According to statistics from the American Cancer Society, melanoma skin cancer cases are only 1% of total cases, but they result in a higher death rate. Melanoma develops in cells called melanocytes. It starts when healthy melanocytes begin to grow out of control, creating a cancerous tumor. It can affect any area of the human body. It usually appears on the areas exposed to sun rays, such as on the hands, face, neck, lips, etc. Melanoma type of cancers can only be cured if diagnosed early; otherwise, they spread to other body parts and lead to the victim’s painful death. Nonmelanoma cancers are easily treated as compared with melanoma cancers.
Therefore, the critical factor in skin cancer treatment is early diagnosis. Doctors ordinarily use the biopsy method for skin cancer detection. This procedure removes a sample from a suspected skin lesion for medical examination to determine whether it is cancerous or not. This process is painful, slow, and time-consuming. Computer-based technology provides a comfortable, less expensive, and speedy diagnosis of skin cancer symptoms. In order to examine the skin cancer symptoms, whether they represent melanoma or nonmelanoma, multiple techniques, noninvasive in nature, are proposed. The general procedure followed in skin cancer detection is acquiring the image, preprocessing, segmenting the acquired preprocessed image, extracting the desired feature, and classifying it.

## SYSTEM DESIGN

## DISCUSSION
Here we have done the detection of skin cancer through deep learning using CNN concept. In this we give the dataset that is our skin images using CNN technique the system will identify using the cancerous skin images from different views and predict whether the skin is cancerous or not. And also we used the data mining algorithm-logistic regression to get the final graphical result model accuracy and model loss.

## CONCLUSION
The current problem that always happened is the peoples do not know several things about their skin care. The peoples only know their problem from their naked eye but the actually happen in their skin is more serious from that. Doctor's diagnosis is reliable, but this procedure takes lots of time, efforts. Accurate skin lesion segmentation in Melanoma Dermoscopy images is an important and difficult task. These routines can be automated. It could save lots of doctor's time and could help to diagnose more accurate. Besides using computerized means there are good opportunity to store information with diagnostic information in order to use it for further investigations or creation of new methods of diagnosis. It is only a few minutes that the patients can wait without doing anything until images and other patient's information are all inputted at the store and the analysis results are outputted. So in order to make the medical world better and convenient we can use the new world technologies.
